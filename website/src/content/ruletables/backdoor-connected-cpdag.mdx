A rule table that finds all nodes that are reachable from set $X$ via a proper definite-status path open given $Z$ that does not start with an edge to a node in $C$ in a completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG). We use this for verifying the adjustment criterion (<Reference id="perkovicComplete" format="author year"/>) for CPDAGs where $C$ is the set of nodes on a causal path between $X$ and the set of outcome variables $Y$.
