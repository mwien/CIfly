In this article, we provide a Python implementation for finding a conditional instrument in an ADMG based on the sound and complete criterion given by <Reference id="henckelIV" format="author(year)"/>. We rely on algorithmic ideas introduced in TODO.

TODO: realistically one should discuss minimal separators before this article can be added. Because we use nearest separator which is very similar. 


<ExampleCode id="sound_and_complete_iv.py"/>

It relies on the following ruletables...

<Ruletable id="ancestors_admg"/>

TODO
