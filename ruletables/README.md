# Rule-table collection

A collection of rule tables used in ```/examples/```. For using one of these ruletables, it is recommended to copy (and if needed, modify) it and put it close to your source code (or even directly into your source code as multi-line strings, see the option ```tableAsString``` in R or ```table_as_string``` in Python for more info on this).

For more details, how these rule tables are used, see the code in ```/examples/``` as well as the examples on the CIfly website.
