# Example Usage of CIfly

The scripts in the subdirectories are examples of using CIfly from Python and R. Note that the code in these directories is not installable as a package, but rather they contain a handful of example scripts that illustrate use of CIfly. Further explanation for these applications can be found on the CIfly [web page](https://cifly.pages.dev/applications/).
