Description: Provides a framework for specifying and running flexible
    linear-time reachability-based algorithms for graphical causal inference. Rule
    tables are used to encode and customize the reachability algorithm to typical
    causal and probabilistic reasoning tasks such as finding d-connected nodes or
    more advanced applications. For more information, see Wienöbst, Weichwald and
    Henckel (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2506.15758>.
